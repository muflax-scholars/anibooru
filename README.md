anibooru
========

A batch downloader script for danbooru


FEATURES
========
- Subdirectories created in destination directory with search tags as
  name for easy organization.
- Script will not attempt to redownload files that already exist
- Can set a limit on # of posts downloaded


ROADMAP
=======
Features that I plan to work on in the future (in no certain order):
- Allow searching of pools
- More customization of filenames (such as tags in filenames, post ID, etc)
- Look into ways to improve HTTP request times?
